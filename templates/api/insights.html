         <h3>Here are the real-data scatter plots showing relationships between weather variables and mood scores:</h3>
         <p>
* Temperature shows a mild positive trend: warmer days might slightly elevate mood.<br>
* Humidity and wind speed appear more scattered with no clear pattern, which aligns with existing studies showing inconsistent mood correlations.<br>
* Air pressure shows a subtle downward trend in mood as pressure risesâ€”also consistent with some studies linking pressure changes to mood shifts.</p>
